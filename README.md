# Cryptocurrencies

# Summary

In this analysis, unsupervised machine learning was applied to cryptocurrency data.  The machine learning relied on primary component analysis (PCA).  After data preprocessing, PCA was used for reducing data dimensions.  K-means analysis was implemented for clustering, and cryptocurrencies predicted (ie learned) were identified by matching up the cluster results with cryptocurrency names.
